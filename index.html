          <p>
            This is my previous position in context (January 2025), written as an assignment in the course Praxis II.
            The unconventional format was permitted and encouraged under the assignment instructions. My current
            position statement keeps the content of the previous iteration, but has two major changes: adding the effect of teamwork to the section on "building off past
            experiences", as well as adding a new section on the importance of planning.
          </p>
          <h2>Iterated Position Statement</h2>
          <p>
            In my previous position statement, I emphasised how I felt it was important to build on past experiences and designs as the cornerstone of innovation. However, through
            collaborative work with an exceptional team, I have come to appreciate that the same experience can be
            interpreted in multiple ways. Each teammate brought a unique perspective, stemming from their individual
            backgrounds and priorities, whether it was an emphasis on precision, safety, cost-effectiveness, or user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engaging with these diverse viewpoints has underscored the importance of a holistic design process in which no
            single interpretation holds all the answers. By actively listening to my teammates’ insights and reconciling our
            differing interpretations of past projects, I have deepened my comprehension of both the engineering process and
            my personal approach to design. This multidimensional feedback loop has refined my perspective, reinforcing that
            iterative learning in engineering design is as much about integrating diverse experiences as it is about building on
            one's own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Planning is an essential element of engineering design that I initially underestimated, viewing it as a potential
            inefficiency. However, my experience taught me that inadequate planning, especially regarding the dimensions and
            interfaces of CAD models where multiple parts must align, can lead to significant rework. When design elements are
            not meticulously coordinated from the outset, valuable time is subsequently lost in revising or reconstructing what
            should have been accurately set up in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, in a collaborative team environment, structured planning plays a pivotal role in ensuring all members share
            a common understanding of project goals and constraints. It facilitates efficient communication, enabling team members
            to seek clarification and coordinate their contributions more effectively. Ultimately, the discipline of thorough planning
            not only optimizes individual workflow but also enhances overall team cohesion, leading to more robust and error-resistant
            design outcomes.
