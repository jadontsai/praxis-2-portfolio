      <p>
        Here is my previous position in context (January 2025), written as an assignment in the course Praxis II.
        The unconventional format was permitted and encouraged under the assignment instructions. My current position statement has two major changes: adding the effect of teamwork to the section on "building off past experiences", as well as adding a new section on the importance of planning.
       </p>
      </p>
        This iteration of my position statement represents an evolution in my understanding of 
          engineering design. Previously, I emphasized building on past experiences as the cornerstone 
          of innovation. However, through collaborative work with an exceptional team, I have come to appreciate 
          that the same experience can be interpreted in multiple ways. Each teammate brought a unique perspective,
           stemming from their individual backgrounds and priorities, whether it was an emphasis on precision, safety, cost-effectiveness, or user experience.
      </p>
      </p>
          Engaging with these diverse viewpoints has underscored the importance of a holistic design process
          in which no single interpretation holds all the answers. By actively listening to my 
          teammatesâ€™ insights and reconciling our differing interpretations of past projects, I have deepened 
          my comprehension of both the engineering process and my personal approach to design. This multidimensional 
          feedback loop has refined my perspective, reinforcing that iterative learning in engineering design is as 
          much about integrating diverse experiences as it is about building on one's own. Through collaboration, I now see 
          that effective planning and design are achieved not just by accumulating past knowledge, but by actively engaging 
          with and synthesizing the varied insights that arise from teamwork.
        </p>
          </p>
          Planning is an essential element of engineering design that I initially underestimated, 
          viewing it as a potential inefficiency. However, my experience taught me that inadequate 
          planning, especially regarding the dimensions and interfaces of CAD models where multiple 
          parts must align, can lead to significant rework. When design elements are not meticulously coordinated from the outset, 
          valuable time is subsequently lost in revising or reconstructing what should have been accurately set up in the first place.
</p>
        </p>
          Moreover, in a collaborative team environment, structured planning plays a pivotal role in ensuring all members share a common 
          understanding of project goals and constraints. It facilitates efficient communication, 
          enabling team members to seek clarification and coordinate their contributions more effectively. 
          Ultimately, the discipline of thorough planning not only optimizes individual workflow but also enhances overall team cohesion,
          leading to more robust and error-resistant design outcomes.
